# dotfiles
Lilly's FreeBSD dotfiles and customizations!

# Customizations include:
- Aliases
- ZSH Prompt
- Help files
- Renaming of PackageManager
- Shortening of "clear" command
- Managing of Audio Devices(1 command to change output to a headphone-jack or any device on 2nd port/0-1=1 device.)
- 1-command call to [Crfetch](https://github.com/Izder456/crfetch) (`sys` alias.)

## Attention!
- These files where made for FreeBSD, if you are going to use them on OpenBSD or NetBSD, make sure to modify them accordingly.
- Be careful with renaming system-utilities.
- These files are here because... i wanna share them, and as a backup of my FreeBSD's dotfiles in case of a failure.

Feel free to use them as you prefer, but don't blame me if you bust your device.
